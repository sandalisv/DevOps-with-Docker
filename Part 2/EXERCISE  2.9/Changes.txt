* I removed ENV REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5000 from backend Dockerfile.

* I removed ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080 from frontend Dockerfile.

* And I added 
	 build: ./example-backend to backend 
	 build: ./example-frontend to fronted 
  in docker-compose yml file. So the images will be built here, and modified dockerfiles since we are now
  accessing frontend and backend through proxy urls set in nginx.
